# SPEC

## §G GOAL

Guard mode: changed paths → specs that cover them.

## §N NAV

rel|path|lens
up|.|-
up|src|product code nodes — scan, detect, registry, catalog, rule, hook, legacy, cover, map, report, gen, lay, seed, confirm, migrate, protect, cli
self|src/map|guard mode: changed paths → covering specs
sib|src/scan|enumerate files, basename → exactly 1 file type
sib|src/detect|active fragments from scanned files, fixed order
sib|src/registry|`.pklith` parse/fmt: types → check sets, rules, plural, exempt
sib|src/catalog|check definitions: category, nix attr, runner glob, hk step, fix, failure msg
sib|src/rule|companion rules: exists, mentions, changed, orphan; path templates
sib|src/hook|read effective hk config via `pkl eval`: step → globs
sib|src/legacy|3 legacy formats: read, `import`, compat entries
sib|src/cover|verdict: type gaps, stale, claim ⊥ backed by runner, rule gaps
